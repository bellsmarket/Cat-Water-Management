# Cat-Water-Management
A program for daily management of how much water a cat drank

It is very important to manage your cat's daily water intake.
Cats are prone to illness if they do not get the right amount of water.
In some cases, it can lead to serious illness or death.

Also the ph value of the water to give is very important.
pH Value = 6.2-6.4
